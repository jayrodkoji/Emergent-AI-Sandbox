# Caeli: Emergent Intelligence Sandbox

**Unveiling the essence of emergence through agent-based simulations.**

--- 

## Overview

Caeli is a research-focused open-source project exploring how complex, emergent behaviours arise from simple interacting agents. Inspired by principlesfrom **complex adaptive systems**, **multi-agent reinforcement learning**, and **quantum-inspired randomness**, Caeli provides a modular sandbox environment for experimentation and visualization.

Our goal is to illumicate the hidden patterns and core essence underlying emergent phenomena - the "Caeli" of intelligence and complexity.

## Features

- Modular grid-world environment simulating agent interatiions
- Configurable agent behaviors: foraging, avoidance, cooperation
- Metrics and visualization tools for observing emergent patterns
- Experimental quantum-inspired randomness integration
- Designed for extensibility and research collaboration

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- See `Requirements.txt` for dependencies

### Installation 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jayrodkoji/caeli-emergent-ai.git
cd caeli-emergent-ai
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Running the Sandbox

```bash
python src/simulation.py

this runs a default simulation with visualization.
